\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of document understanding, enabling systems to extract, summarize, and reason over vast amounts of unstructured text. However, in the financial domain, documents such as 10-K filings, earnings reports, and investment prospectuses present a unique challenge: they are inherently multimodal, densely interleaving narrative prose with structured numerical tables. For instance, a single paragraph in a Management Discussion and Analysis (MD\&A) section often references specific values in a balance sheet or income statement, requiring a system to simultaneously comprehend linguistic nuance and perform precise arithmetic verification.

Current state-of-the-art approaches, primarily based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), exhibit significant limitations when applied to this context. Standard RAG systems typically process documents by flattening tables into text or treating them as separate, disconnected modalities. This fragmentation leads to a loss of structural integrity, where row-column relationships are obscured, and the critical semantic links between a table cell and its referencing text are severed. Consequently, comparisons on benchmarks like FinQA and FinanceBench reveal a stark performance gap; while human experts achieve near-90\% accuracy on complex financial reasoning tasks, leading LLMs often struggle to surpass 76\%, frequently hallucinating numbers or failing to perform multi-step calculations correctly.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce HierFinRAG, a hierarchical multimodal framework designed explicitly for financial document understanding. Our approach is founded on two core innovations. First, we propose a Table-Text Graph Neural Network (TTGNN) that constructs a unified knowledge graph from the document, representing sections, paragraphs, tables, and cells as interconnected nodes. This allows the model to learn and preserve the structural hierarchy and cross-referential dependencies that are vital for navigating financial reports. Second, we implement a Symbolic-Neural Fusion reasoning module. Rather than relying solely on the probabilistic generation of an LLM for arithmetic, our system identifies numerical intents and offloads calculations to a deterministic symbolic engine, ensuring mathematical precision while retaining the linguistic flexibility of neural models.

By bridging the gap between unstructured text and structured data, HierFinRAG aims to provide a robust solution for automated financial analysis. In this paper, we detail the architecture of our system, demonstrate its superior performance on standard benchmarks, and analyze the efficiency gains offered by our hierarchical retrieval strategy.
