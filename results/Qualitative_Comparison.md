|  1 | Summarize the primary risk factor regarding battery supply chains.                                 | The primary risk factor regarding battery supply chains is their dependence on a limited number of critical raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. These materials are often sourced from a few key geographic regions, leading to several risks:                                                                        | Error calling gemini-1.5-flash: 404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.
