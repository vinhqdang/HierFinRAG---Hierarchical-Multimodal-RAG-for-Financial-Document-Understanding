\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented HierFinRAG, a novel framework addressing the critical limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the financial domain. By treating financial documents not as linear text but as hierarchical, multimodal graphs, and by augmenting neural generation with deterministic symbolic reasoning, we have established a new standard for automated financial analysis.

Our experimental results on FinQA and FinanceBench demonstrate that HierFinRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an Exact Match accuracy of 82.5\% while reducing inference latency by approximately 3.5x compared to agentic workflows. These findings confirm our hypothesis that explicitly modeling the structural dependencies between tabular data and narrative text is essential for accurate retrieval and reasoning. As financial AI systems increasingly transition from experimental pilots to production deployments, frameworks like HierFinRAG that prioritize structural integrity and mathematical precision will be pivotal in building user trust and ensuring regulatory compliance.
